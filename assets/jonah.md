## Sermon
Jonah Chapter 1 verse 1 to 3 shows God's call to Jonah, and Jonah rebellious responses to do opposite God's commandment.
In verse 4 to 6, a tempest rages and causes big problems for the mariner's in Jonah's boat, while Jonah is sound asleep in the hull.
Next section verse 7 to 10, Jonah reveals his full identity to the mariners and, it also becomes known he is the source of the mariners problems.
Next section, Jonah offers a solution, to throw him into the sea.  Initially, the mariners do not, but try to save themselves and him, rowing the boat harder.
However, this is to no avail.  The tempest is much stronger than the rowers.  So they reluctantly throw the prophet in to the sea.  
Seeing the immediate calm of the storm, the mariners fear God greatly and worship. 

The second half of Jonah chapter 1 shows a pitiful man who inadvertently witnesses and converts a boat full of sailors to worship and fear God.
In first three verses of the first chapter, God calls Jonah, and rebellious Jonah runs away.
The remaining verses shows to parallel stories, a pitiful rebellious prophet, and the conversion story of a boat full of mariners.
First, God sends a tempest, so strong it threatens to break up the ship.
The mariners start pleading to their gods, and hurling cargo.  
The mariners believe the storm is coming from an angry god, and it is a spiritual problem.  

They find Jonah, and cast lots.  It is reveal Jonah is the source of the problem.
He proclaims he is a Hebrew and his God is the Lord God
This is the mariners problem only, apparently.  Jonah is unfazed.  This is not his problem.  Taken a nice nap is his biggest concern.


## Jonah 1 v1-3

> 1 Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,  
> 2 "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for their evil has come up before me."  
> 3 But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the Lord.

## Jonah 1 v4-6

> 4 But the Lord hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up.  
> 5 Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep.  
> 6 So the captain came and said to him, "What do you mean, you sleeper? Arise, call out to your god! Perhaps the god will give a thought to us, that we may not perish."
